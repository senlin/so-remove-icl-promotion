This free [WPML](http://wpml.org) Addon removes all promotion for ICanLocalize from the WPML plugin.

== Description ==

By default the WPML plugin includes promotion for their own translation service ICanLocalize. This translation service comes at competitive rates and is completely integrated in the WPML Dashboard.

It is a great service to have for most people, however translation agencies are less happy about it. We have heard from many different agencies that they are wary to install WPML, just because of the inline advertisements for a competing service.

With the SO Remove ICL Promotion plugin activated the promotion is removed from several place throughout your Dashboard:

* dashboard widget
* edit Post/Page/Custom Post Type screens
* WPML Troubleshooting page
* translation management screen (separate addon) 

We support this plugin exclusively through [Github](https://github.com/senlin/so-remove-icl-promotion/issues).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is the settings page? =

You can stop looking, there is none. Activate the plugin to remove the ICanLocalize promotions, deactivate the plugin to bring them back.

= Known Limitations =

If your wp-config.php file is not placed in the root of your WordPress install AND/OR your wp-config.php file is not writable AND/OR you have named the wp-config.php file differently, the plugin will not work. It might show as activated, but it will not have removed anything.
Adding a proper error notification is on the todo-list.
